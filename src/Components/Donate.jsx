      <p className="donate-1">Thank you for your generosity. Your contribution will be used to post bail for people held in NYC jails, prioritizing BIPOC trans people, medically high-risk or otherwise marginalized populations, and anyone within the broader LGBTQ+ spectrum. Additionally, we assist with ICE detention immigration bonds for LGBTQ+ detainees. 

A small portion of your contribution may be used for post-release support kits and costs associated with posting bail (transportation, PPE, etc.).
